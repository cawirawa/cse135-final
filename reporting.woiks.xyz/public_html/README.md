## Checkpoint 1.
I have been trying to create a authenthication via sessioning by utilizing express and passportjs. You can now login and get redirected to index2.html. If you pass the wrong login, you will get a response of {"alerts":"Failed to serialize user into session"} for now. I have not had time to catch the response in the front end as an alert, i would do it in the future. index2.html is just a dummy to check if login works, it is not an authenticated route that can only be accessed when logged in.
